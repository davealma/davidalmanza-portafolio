        I start working on a ecommerce tool with friends as my first job.
        
        Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with both in-person and remote teams,
        gaining valuable experience in adapting to diverse working environments.
        Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work with clients from different parts of the world,
        which has improved my abilities to perform under pressure and make decisions.

        <br/>

        I have been working as a software engineer with different clients looking for solutions which satisfy the client.
        I have the opportunity to work on Front End projects as Back End so I have the ability to understand the requirements on each side.
        Also I love to learn and keep constantly reading and applying new and latest industryâ€™s concepts and standards.
